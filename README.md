# Yet Another Calendar Widget

## What

*Yet Another Calendar Widget* is yet another calendar widget.  

**This app is still in its early stages.**  

It's designed and developed solely for my personal use, 
primarily to showcase a list of anime airing dates in the calendar.   
It can display schedules in intervals of three days or one week.

<!-- |    three days view   |     weekly view     | -->

## Why

The main motivation behind it is that existing calendar widgets, 
while feature-rich and beautifully designed, 
often lack the display of schedules prior to the current time.   
Plus, it's free!

## Todo

- [ ] Generalization (such as displaying information from multiple calendars)
- [ ] Stability (there's currently a high chance of automatic information updates not functioning)
- [ ] Enhancement of app details (eliminating hard-coded strings, adding widget previews, etc.)
